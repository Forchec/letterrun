## WORKFLOW

Start with the master branch.

Create a new branch – Do this for each new task/feature, Branch names should reflect the task/feature that is being developed.

Update, add, commit, and push changes- Make sure to push changes when one step is done, this will help us to keep track of our
                                      changes and find a way to recover if something goes wrong. 
                                      
Push feature branch to remote – Feature branch is updated in the central repository for other team members to view changes.

Resolve feedback – Have someone else review your code before merging.

Merge your pull request – Check for any conflicts and add the code to the master branch.


## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

Commit Message should be informative for what is changed/removed/added. Example: “Added character select screen functionality” or “Changed settings page instructions”
